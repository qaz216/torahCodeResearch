Ripps paper here:

I have obtained the character-by-character data set used in this experiment.

Raw Data Here:

Genesis:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Genesis.txt

Exodus:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Exodus.txt

Leviticus:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Leviticus.txt

Deuteronomy:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Deuteronomy.txt

Numbers:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Numbers.txt

I have validated this data against the widely referenced 'Michael Dov Weissmandl' (Weissmandl Sequence) by myself personally.
