# Gathered are the exact 'character' sequences detailing the original 5 Books of the Bible "character-by-character"


Ripps paper here:

I have obtained the character-by-character data set used in this experiment.

Raw Data Here:

Genesis:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Genesis.txt

Exodus:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Exodus.txt

Leviticus:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Leviticus.txt

Deuteronomy:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Deuteronomy.txt

Numbers:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Numbers.txt

I have validated this data against the widely referenced 'Michael Dov Weissmandl' (Weissmandl Sequence) by myself personally.

I have personally validated that this data represents the exact character for character sequence of the 5 books of the Bible to the best of my knowledge.  The oldest known version of this document can be dated back to the "Dead Sea Scrolls" of 2000+ years ago.  Jewish scollorship dates this document at apx: 3,300 years ago.

I was put in touch with someone involved in this research and have obtained the above 5 data sets (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Numbers).
